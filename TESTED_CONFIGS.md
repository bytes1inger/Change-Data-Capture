# Tested and Untested Configurations

## Tested Configurations

The following configurations have been tested and confirmed working:

### Source Connectors
- `connectors/source-src1.json`: Source connector for src1 database
- `connectors/source-src2.json`: Source connector for src2 database
- `connectors/source-src3.json`: Source connector for src3 database

### Sink Connectors
- `connectors/debezium-sink-users.json`: Sink connector for users table from src1
- `connectors/debezium-sink-users-src2.json`: Sink connector for users table from src2
- `connectors/debezium-sink-users-src3.json`: Sink connector for users table from src3
- `connectors/debezium-sink.json`: Sink connector for orders table from src1
- `connectors/debezium-sink-orders-src2.json`: Sink connector for orders table from src2
- `connectors/debezium-sink-orders-src3.json`: Sink connector for orders table from src3

### Scripts
- `generate_orders.sh`: Script to generate test data

## Untested Configurations

The following configurations have not been fully tested and have been moved to the `connectors/trial-config/` directory:

### Trial Configurations
- `sink-src1.json`: Original sink connector configuration
- `sink-src1-modified.json`: Modified sink connector configuration
- `sink-src1-simple.json`: Simplified sink connector configuration
- `sink-src1-fields.json`: Fields-based sink connector configuration
- `sink-src2.json`: Original sink connector for src2
- `sink-src2-modified.json`: Modified sink connector for src2
- `sink-src3.json`: Original sink connector for src3
- `sink-src3-modified.json`: Modified sink connector for src3
- `sink-debezium.json`: Alternative Debezium sink configuration
- `connector-registration-endpoints.txt`: Notes on connector registration endpoints

## Next Steps

The multi-source CDC pipeline has been fully implemented. Next steps could include:

1. Implement monitoring and alerting for the CDC pipeline
2. Add error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. Set up automated tests for the pipeline
4. Implement schema evolution handling
5. Optimize performance and resource usage
